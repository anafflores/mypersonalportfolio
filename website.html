        <h3 id="welcome">Hi! I'm Ana Fernanda Flores </h3>
        <span>I'm currently working at Codifin and I'm being prepared to be a full-stack
        engineer. I'm in my gap year before I go to college and study Entertainment Business Administration.
        I live in Mexico City. I love watching Netflix, dancing, learning other languages and spendinng time
        with my family. I'm still on the first lessons of Codecademy, however I have made some projects that
        I will present in this web site. I hope you can see them all and provide any feedback ;). </span>

            <h3>My first web page</h3>
            <p>This was my very first website. It is very simple because it was made
                at the beggining of HTML lessons. I applied what I learned of fundamentals of HTML such as
            headings, unoredered lists and links. </p>

            <h3>CSS Selectors Cheat Sheet</h3>
            <p>This website is not only a cheat sheet of selectors lesson, but also its an HTML that includes
            two tables with different information each of them.

            <h3>Website Desing System</h3>
            <p>This web page is a style guide for a website. The main purpose of this website was to practice
                styling after the CSS lesson. I used diferent colors, backgrounds, fonts, font sizes, adjusted
                margins and borders.

            <h3>Tea Cozy</h3>
            <p>In this project, the platform provided me with the resources I needed to apply to the website and 
                an example of how the final veision should look like. The main objective was to apply what I had 
                previously learned about HTML and CSS.

            <h3>Company Home Page</h3>
            <p>In this project I needed to make a home page for an imaginary company that included a logo, navigation 
                bar, products (in this case I showed the services the company offered), team members and a contact using
                HTML and CSS. I think this might have been the biggest challenge I have had until now because I needed to 
                plan everything about how the website's content design and then make it different elements of CSS.
